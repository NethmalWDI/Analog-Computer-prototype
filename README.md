# Analog-Computer-prototype

## 1. Introduction
- This project, titled 'Analog Computer', aims to explore and demonstrate the functionality of opamp circuits in performing fundamental analog computations â€“ addition, subtraction, and multiplication. The utilization of these analog operations holds immense potential in the field of analog signal processing. The project will dive into the design and implementation of analog adder, subtractor, and multiplier circuits, analysing their underlying principles and practical applications.<br/>


## 2. Technical Specifications

### 1.  Operations:
- 1.1 Addition
- 1.2 Subtraction
- 1.3 Multiplication
### 2. Analog Computing Principles: 
Utilize operational amplifier (op-amp) circuits for implementing the desired operations. We have designed dedicated circuits for each operation, considering appropriate signal conditioning and biasing.
### 3. Frequency Range: 
The device can perform computations on waveforms within the frequency range of 1 Hz to 10 kHz.
### 4. Addition and Subtraction: 
Separate analog adder and subtractor circuits. The circuits handle both positive and negative input voltages and produce accurate results
within the specified frequency range.
### 5. Multiplication: 
An analog multiplier circuit capable of accurately multiplying two input waveforms in all four quadrants. The multiplier has a controllable gain and operational within
the specified frequency range.
### 6. Input and Output: 
Dual-channel input interfaces for each operation. The input interfaces accept waveforms within the specified frequency range and proper impedance matching is ensured. Output interfaces deliver computed results with minimal distortion.
### 7. Control Interface: 
Control mechanisms for adjusting gain, biasing, and operation mode (addition, subtraction, multiplication) using potentiometers.
